About the dataset

Imagine a telecommunications provider has segmented its customer base by service usage patterns, categorizing the customers into four groups. If demographic data can be used to predict group membership, the company can customize offers for individual prospective customers. It is a classification problem. That is, given the dataset, with predefined labels, we need to build a model to be used to predict class of a new or unknown case.

The example focuses on using demographic data, such as region, age, and marital, to predict usage patterns.

The target field, called custcat, has four possible values that correspond to the four customer groups, as follows: 1- Basic Service 2- E-Service 3- Plus Service 4- Total Service

Our objective is to build a classifier, to predict the class of unknown cases. We will use a specific type of classification called K nearest neighbour.

Lets download the dataset. To download the data, we will use !wget to download it from IBM Object Storage.

Letâ€™s see how many of each class is in our data set
In [3]:

df['custcat'].value_counts()

Out[3]:

4    236
2    217
Name: custcat, dtype: int64

281 Plus Service, 266 Basic-service, 236 Total Service, and 217 E-Service customers

You can easily explore your data using visualization techniques:
In [4]:

df.hist(column='income', bins=50)

Out[4]:

array([[<matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot object at 0x00000292D30A6B88>]],

Feature set

Lets define feature sets, X:
In [5]:

df.columns

Out[5]:

Index(['region', 'tenure', 'age', 'marital', 'address', 'income', 'ed',
       'employ', 'retire', 'gender', 'reside', 'custcat'],
      dtype='object')

To use scikit-learn library, we have to convert the Pandas data frame to a Numpy array:
In [6]:

X = df[['region', 'tenure','age', 'marital', 'address', 'income', 'ed', 'employ','retire', 'gender', 'reside']] .values  #.astype(float)
X[0:5]

Out[6]:

array([[  2.,  13.,  44.,   1.,   9.,  64.,   4.,   5.,   0.,   0.,   2.],
       [  3.,  11.,  33.,   1.,   7., 136.,   5.,   5.,   0.,   0.,   6.],
       [  3.,  68.,  52.,   1.,  24., 116.,   1.,  29.,   0.,   1.,   2.],
       [  2.,  33.,  33.,   0.,  12.,  33.,   2.,   0.,   0.,   1.,   1.],
       [  2.,  23.,  30.,   1.,   9.,  30.,   1.,   2.,   0.,   0.,   4.]])

What are our labels?
In [7]:

y = df['custcat'].values
y[0:5]

Out[7]:

array([1, 4, 3, 1, 3], dtype=int64)

Normalize Data

Data Standardization give data zero mean and unit variance, it is good practice, especially for algorithms such as KNN which is based on distance of cases:
In [8]:

X = preprocessing.StandardScaler().fit(X).transform(X.astype(float))
X[0:5]

Train Test Split

Out of Sample Accuracy is the percentage of correct predictions that the model makes on data that that the model has NOT been trained on. Doing a train and test on the same dataset will most likely have low out-of-sample accuracy, due to the likelihood of being over-fit.

It is important that our models have a high, out-of-sample accuracy, because the purpose of any model, of course, is to make correct predictions on unknown data. So how can we improve out-of-sample accuracy? One way is to use an evaluation approach called Train/Test Split. Train/Test Split involves splitting the dataset into training and testing sets respectively, which are mutually exclusive. After which, you train with the training set and test with the testing set.

This will provide a more accurate evaluation on out-of-sample accuracy because the testing dataset is not part of the dataset that have been used to train the data. It is more realistic for real world problems.
In [9]:

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split( X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=4)
print ('Train set:', X_train.shape,  y_train.shape)
print ('Test set:', X_test.shape,  y_test.shape)

Train set: (800, 11) (800,)
Test set: (200, 11) (200,)

Classification
K nearest neighbor (KNN)
Import library

Classifier implementing the k-nearest neighbors vote.
In [10]:

from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier

Training

Lets start the algorithm with k=4 for now:
In [11]:

k = 4
#Train Model and Predict  
neigh = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors = k).fit(X_train,y_train)
neigh

Out[11]:

KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=4)

Predicting

we can use the model to predict the test set:
In [12]:

yhat = neigh.predict(X_test)
yhat[0:5]

Out[12]:

array([1, 1, 3, 2, 4], dtype=int64)

Accuracy evaluation

In multilabel classification, accuracy classification score is a function that computes subset accuracy. This function is equal to the jaccard_similarity_score function. Essentially, it calculates how closely the actual labels and predicted labels are matched in the test set.
In [13]:

from sklearn import metrics
print("Train set Accuracy: ", metrics.accuracy_score(y_train, neigh.predict(X_train)))
print("Test set Accuracy: ", metrics.accuracy_score(y_test, yhat))

Train set Accuracy:  0.5475
Test set Accuracy:  0.32

Practice

Can you build the model again, but this time with k=6?
In [15]:

# write your code here
k = 6
neigh6 = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors = k).fit(X_train,y_train)
yhat6 = neigh6.predict(X_test)
print("Train set Accuracy: ", metrics.accuracy_score(y_train, neigh6.predict(X_train)))
print("Test set Accuracy: ", metrics.accuracy_score(y_test, yhat6))

Train set Accuracy:  0.51625
Test set Accuracy:  0.31

What about other K?

K in KNN, is the number of nearest neighbors to examine. It is supposed to be specified by the User. So, how can we choose right value for K? The general solution is to reserve a part of your data for testing the accuracy of the model. Then chose k =1, use the training part for modeling, and calculate the accuracy of prediction using all samples in your test set. Repeat this process, increasing the k, and see which k is the best for your model.

We can calculate the accuracy of KNN for different Ks.
In [16]:

Ks = 10
mean_acc = np.zeros((Ks-1))
std_acc = np.zeros((Ks-1))
ConfustionMx = [];
for n in range(1,Ks):
    
    #Train Model and Predict  
    neigh = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors = n).fit(X_train,y_train)
    yhat=neigh.predict(X_test)
    mean_acc[n-1] = metrics.accuracy_score(y_test, yhat)

    
    std_acc[n-1]=np.std(yhat==y_test)/np.sqrt(yhat.shape[0])

mean_acc

Out[16]:

array([0.3  , 0.29 , 0.315, 0.32 , 0.315, 0.31 , 0.335, 0.325, 0.34 ])

Plot model accuracy for Different number of Neighbors
In [17]:

plt.plot(range(1,Ks),mean_acc,'g')
plt.fill_between(range(1,Ks),mean_acc - 1 * std_acc,mean_acc + 1 * std_acc, alpha=0.10)
plt.legend(('Accuracy ', '+/- 3xstd'))
plt.ylabel('Accuracy ')
plt.xlabel('Number of Nabors (K)')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

In [18]:

print( "The best accuracy was with", mean_acc.max(), "with k=", mean_acc.argmax()+1)

The best accuracy was with 0.34 with k= 9
