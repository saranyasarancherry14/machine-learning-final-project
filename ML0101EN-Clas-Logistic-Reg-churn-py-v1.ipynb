What is the difference between Linear and Logistic Regression?

While Linear Regression is suited for estimating continuous values (e.g. estimating house price), it is not the best tool for predicting the class of an observed data point. In order to estimate the class of a data point, we need some sort of guidance on what would be the most probable class for that data point. For this, we use Logistic Regression.


As you know, Linear regression finds a function that relates a continuous dependent variable, y, to some predictors (independent variables $x_1$, $x_2$, etc.). For example, Simple linear regression assumes a function of the form:

$$ y = \theta_0 + \theta_1 x_1 + \theta_2 x_2 + \cdots $$
and finds the values of parameters $\theta_0, \theta_1, \theta_2$, etc, where the term $\theta_0$ is the "intercept". It can be generally shown as:

$$ ‚Ñé_\theta(ùë•) = \theta^TX $$

Logistic Regression is a variation of Linear Regression, useful when the observed dependent variable, y, is categorical. It produces a formula that predicts the probability of the class label as a function of the independent variables.

Logistic regression fits a special s-shaped curve by taking the linear regression and transforming the numeric estimate into a probability with the following function, which is called sigmoid function ùúé:
$$ ‚Ñé_\theta(ùë•) = \sigma({\theta^TX}) = \frac {e^{(\theta_0 + \theta_1 x_1 + \theta_2 x_2 +...)}}{1 + e^{(\theta_0 + \theta_1 x_1 + \theta_2 x_2 +\cdots)}} $$

Or: $$ ProbabilityOfaClass_1 = P(Y=1|X) = \sigma({\theta^TX}) = \frac{e^{\theta^TX}}{1+e^{\theta^TX}} $$

In this equation, ${\theta^TX}$ is the regression result (the sum of the variables weighted by the coefficients), exp is the exponential function and $\sigma(\theta^TX)$ is the sigmoid or logistic function, also called logistic curve. It is a common "S" shape (sigmoid curve).

So, briefly, Logistic Regression passes the input through the logistic/sigmoid but then treats the result as a probability:

The objective of Logistic Regression algorithm, is to find the best parameters Œ∏, for $‚Ñé_\theta(ùë•)$ = $\sigma({\theta^TX})$, in such a way that the model best predicts the class of each case.
Customer churn with Logistic Regression

A telecommunications company is concerned about the number of customers leaving their land-line business for cable competitors. They need to understand who is leaving. Imagine that you are an analyst at this company and you have to find out who is leaving and why.

Lets first import required libraries:
In [1]:

import pandas as pd
import pylab as pl
import numpy as np
import scipy.optimize as opt
from sklearn import preprocessing
%matplotlib inline 
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

About the dataset
We will use a telecommunications dataset for predicting customer churn. This is a historical customer dataset where each row represents one customer. The data is relatively easy to understand, and you may uncover insights you can use immediately. Typically it is less expensive to keep customers than acquire new ones, so the focus of this analysis is to predict the customers who will stay with the company.

This data set provides information to help you predict what behavior will help you to retain customers. You can analyze all relevant customer data and develop focused customer retention programs.

The dataset includes information about:

    Customers who left within the last month ‚Äì the column is called Churn
    Services that each customer has signed up for ‚Äì phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies
    Customer account information ‚Äì how long they had been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges
    Demographic info about customers ‚Äì gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents

Load the Telco Churn data

Telco Churn is a hypothetical data file that concerns a telecommunications company's efforts to reduce turnover in its customer base. Each case corresponds to a separate customer and it records various demographic and service usage information. Before you can work with the data, you must use the URL to get the ChurnData.csv.

To download the data, we will use !wget to download it from IBM Object Storage.

Data pre-processing and selection

Lets select some features for the modeling. Also we change the target data type to be integer, as it is a requirement by the skitlearn algorithm:
In [4]:

churn_df = churn_df[['tenure', 'age', 'address', 'income', 'ed', 'employ', 'equip',   'callcard', 'wireless','churn']]
churn_df['churn'] = churn_df['churn'].astype('int')
churn_df.head()

Train/Test dataset

Okay, we split our dataset into train and test set:
In [9]:

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split( X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=4)
print ('Train set:', X_train.shape,  y_train.shape)
print ('Test set:', X_test.shape,  y_test.shape)

Train set: (160, 7) (160,)
Test set: (40, 7) (40,)

Modeling (Logistic Regression with Scikit-learn)

Lets build our model using LogisticRegression from Scikit-learn package. This function implements logistic regression and can use different numerical optimizers to find parameters, including ‚Äònewton-cg‚Äô, ‚Äòlbfgs‚Äô, ‚Äòliblinear‚Äô, ‚Äòsag‚Äô, ‚Äòsaga‚Äô solvers. You can find extensive information about the pros and cons of these optimizers if you search it in internet.

The version of Logistic Regression in Scikit-learn, support regularization. Regularization is a technique used to solve the overfitting problem in machine learning models. C parameter indicates inverse of regularization strength which must be a positive float. Smaller values specify stronger regularization. Now lets fit our model with train set:
In [10]:

from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix
LR = LogisticRegression(C=0.01, solver='liblinear').fit(X_train,y_train)
LR

Out[10]:

LogisticRegression(C=0.01, class_weight=None, dual=False, fit_intercept=True,
          intercept_scaling=1, max_iter=100, multi_class='warn',
          n_jobs=None, penalty='l2', random_state=None, solver='liblinear',
          tol=0.0001, verbose=0, warm_start=False)

Now we can predict using our test set:
In [11]:

yhat = LR.predict(X_test)
yhat

Out[11]:

array([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0,
       0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0])

predict_proba returns estimates for all classes, ordered by the label of classes. So, the first column is the probability of class 1, P(Y=1|X), and second column is probability of class 0, P(Y=0|X):
In [12]:

yhat_prob = LR.predict_proba(X_test)

Evaluation
jaccard index

Lets try jaccard index for accuracy evaluation. we can define jaccard as the size of the intersection divided by the size of the union of two label sets. If the entire set of predicted labels for a sample strictly match with the true set of labels, then the subset accuracy is 1.0; otherwise it is 0.0.
